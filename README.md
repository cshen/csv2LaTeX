This is a very basic script to convert csv files to LaTeX code.

I did this a long time ago and would certainly do it a lot differently now but a colleague asked me for the tool so I thought I'd put it up. A blog post a wrote a while back explaining how it works is [here](http://drvinceknight.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/theres-great-website-that-ive-used-many.html) and a blog post describing alternative (better) ways of doing this is available [here](http://texblog.org/2012/05/30/generate-latex-tables-from-csv-files-excel/).
